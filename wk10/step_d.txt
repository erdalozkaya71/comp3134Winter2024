There are two warning messages:

1) A scandir() function failure with the parameter "Hello", indicating there's no such directory or file. 
2) A scandir() function failure without any parameter provided (due to the default value '.'), which usually lists the current directory's contents. 

Sensitive information given by this page includes:
