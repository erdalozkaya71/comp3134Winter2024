Stored cross-site scripting occurs when an application unsafely stores user input and 
subsequently includes it in future responses. This script, once embedded, is displayed to all users 
who visit the website. If these users interact with the script by clicking a link contained within it, 
they may unwittingly become victims of malware or similar harmful software without their knowledge.
